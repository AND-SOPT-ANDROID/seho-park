# Baseline profile rules for androidx.compose.animation.core
# =============================================
# In practice it seems like almost every class in animation/core ends up getting loaded in even a
# relatively small sample, and most end up getting marked as "HSP". Since Animation is a high value
# target for performance - fade in, scroll, etc we are going to be liberal in the animation profile
# rules and just mark the entire module.
